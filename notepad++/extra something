peering

vpc
routing table

EFS(Elastic File System)
efs-1.create a EFS
    2.create two linux machine
	3.mount the efs on linux machines
	
Create EFS 
Add Security group of Ec2 instaces to EFS Network Security Group 

Create 2 Ec2 Instances Linux
Same Security groups for both instances 

sudo su
sudo yum install -y amazon-efs-utils
goto efs attach then take command- (sudo mount -t efs -o tls fs-08df0b7f007d62c79:/ efs) and run on ec2 terminals to mount efs on each teermials
allow the nfs port(2049) in EC2 instance sg
sudo mkdir efs in both instances
after that efs folder will be shared among the linux users



so to practice :
1. create VPC
2. create Subnet: public and private
3. create route tables for both 
4. add IGW 
5. Add NAT 
6. Try Peering after creating second VPC 
7. Endpiont 
 seems ok right ?
